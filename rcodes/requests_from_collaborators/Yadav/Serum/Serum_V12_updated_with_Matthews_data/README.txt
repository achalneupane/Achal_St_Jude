This version is in continuation of V9. Here, I am selecting from those that have more than 1 vial. I am also removing any samples with the last vial which I determined from V10, R file: plasma_table_2_v10_vial_zero_excluded_extract_1200_batch_1.R .

The only difference from V9 is that I will be removiing those samples with vial <2.
