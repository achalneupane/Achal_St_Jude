Preprocessing: The first step is to preprocess the raw sequencing data. This includes quality control, adapter trimming, and removing low-quality reads. The resulting reads are then mapped to a reference genome or assembled de novo.

Counting: The next step is to count the number of reads that align to each small RNA sequence. This can be done using tools such as HTSeq or featureCounts.

Normalization: Once the counts have been obtained, the data needs to be normalized to account for differences in sequencing depth and other sources of variation. Common normalization methods include total count normalization, median normalization, and TMM normalization.

Clustering: After normalization, the data can be used for unsupervised hierarchical clustering. This involves constructing a dendrogram based on the pairwise distances between samples or small RNA sequences. There are various clustering algorithms available, such as Ward's method, complete linkage, and single linkage.

Visualization: Finally, the results of the clustering can be visualized using a heatmap or a dendrogram. Heatmaps can be used to show the expression levels of individual small RNAs across different samples, while dendrograms can be used to illustrate the relationships between samples based on their small RNA expression profiles.

TMM (trimmed mean of M values) normalization is a widely used method for normalizing RNA sequencing data. It is particularly useful for addressing compositional bias in RNA sequencing data, which can arise due to differences in library size or sequencing depth between samples. TMM normalization accounts for these differences by scaling the read counts of each sample so that the trimmed mean of the log fold changes between the samples is zero.

Here's how you can perform TMM normalization:

Calculate raw counts: Start by calculating the raw counts for each gene or transcript in each sample. This can be done using tools such as HTSeq or featureCounts.

Calculate library sizes: Next, calculate the library size for each sample, which is the total number of reads that were sequenced in that sample. This can be done by summing the raw counts for all genes or transcripts in each sample.

Calculate scaling factors: Calculate the scaling factors for each sample using the TMM method. This involves calculating the geometric mean of the counts for each gene or transcript across all samples, and then calculating the ratio of the geometric mean for each sample to the overall geometric mean. The scaling factor for each sample is then calculated as the median ratio across all genes or transcripts.

Apply scaling factors: Apply the scaling factors to the raw counts for each sample, so that the read counts are adjusted based on the scaling factors. This results in normalized counts that are adjusted for library size and compositional bias.

TMM normalization can be implemented using various tools and software packages, such as edgeR, DESeq2, and limma-voom. These packages typically provide functions that automate the TMM normalization process, making it relatively straightforward to perform.

There are several methods for clustering RNA sequencing data, including hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, and model-based clustering. Here's how you can perform hierarchical clustering:

Preprocessing: Start by preprocessing the RNA sequencing data. This includes quality control, adapter trimming, removing low-quality reads, and aligning the reads to a reference genome or transcriptome. The resulting data should be in the form of a table of read counts or normalized expression values for each gene or transcript in each sample.

Distance calculation: Calculate the pairwise distances between samples or genes/transcripts based on their expression profiles. Common distance metrics include Euclidean distance, Pearson correlation, and Spearman correlation.

Clustering algorithm: Choose a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group the samples or genes/transcripts based on their pairwise distances. The most commonly used algorithms are Ward's method, complete linkage, and single linkage. Ward's method is often preferred because it tends to produce more balanced and compact clusters.

Dendrogram visualization: Visualize the results of the hierarchical clustering using a dendrogram. A dendrogram is a tree-like diagram that shows the relationships between the samples or genes/transcripts based on their clustering.

Cluster assignment: Based on the dendrogram, assign samples or genes/transcripts to clusters based on their position in the tree. The number of clusters can be chosen based on visual inspection of the dendrogram or using statistical methods such as the elbow method or silhouette score.

There are various tools and software packages available for performing hierarchical clustering of RNA sequencing data, including R packages such as hclust and dendextend, as well as web-based tools such as ClustVis and Heatmapper. These tools typically provide functions or interfaces for performing the various steps of the clustering process.
