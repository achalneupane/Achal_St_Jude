# Can you please do the following when you get a chance?

# Extract all the non-synonymous variants within the four genes (Gnptab, Slc25a3, Uhrf1bp1l, and Chpt1) among all SJLIFE survivors. They are all on chromosome 12. Please use the WGS data.
# Perform association analysis with cardiomyopathy using Fisherâ€™s Exact test (without any covariates). This will be just 2 by 3 table. Please do this for Grade 2 or higher vs. Grade 0, as well as Grade 3 or higher vs. Grade 0. Survivors should be exposed to anthracyclines alone without chest RT.
 
# Can you then repeat above 1) and 2) for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants only?
